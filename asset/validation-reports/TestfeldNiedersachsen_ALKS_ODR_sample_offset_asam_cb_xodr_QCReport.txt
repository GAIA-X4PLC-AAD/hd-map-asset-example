Note

Rule UID format:
    <emanating-entity>:<standard>:x.y.z:rule_set.for_rules.rule_name

where    
    Emanating Entity: a domain name for the entity (organization or company) that declares the rule UID
    Standard: a short string that represents the standard or the domain to which the rule is applied
    Definition Setting: the version of the standard or the domain to which the rule appears or is applied for the first time
    Rule Full Name: the full name of the rule, as dot separated, snake lower case string. 
        The full name of a rule is composed by the rule set, a categorization for the rule, 
        and the rule name, a unique string inside the categorization. 
        The rule set can be nested (meaning that can be defined as an 
        arbitrary sequence of dot separated names, while the name is the snake 
        case string after the last dot of the full name)
